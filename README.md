# CaptchaArt captcha mass generator

A fork of [Securimage] including a script that enables bulk captcha generation.

This is created purely to make it easier to create [CaptchaArt comics](https://reddit.com/r/CaptchaArt).

**Notice:** Securimage has been modified to output in a file, and not to dump images to the browser. All class fields
are also changed to be `public`.

## WAIT!

Of course, the script can be easily modified to get custom captcha text. **Don't do this**, autogenerated text is what
makes CaptchaArt fun!

## Usage

- `php generate.php` – Generate a single captcha.
- `php generate.php 100` – Generate 100 captchas.
- `php generate.php 100 directory` – Generate 100 captchas in `directory`

All captchas will be saved in the directory `captchas` under the same name as the captcha text.

## Requirements

Same as [Securimage], no database required.

- PHP 5.4 or greater
- GD 2.0
- FreeType (Required, for TTF fonts)
